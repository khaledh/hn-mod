# Hacker News Mod chrome extension

This is a very early version of a chrome extension I use personally to "dim" stories based on keywords and/or domain names. You can also dim/undim stories manually (a link is added under each story).

1. Clone the repo
2. Enable developer mode under Manage Extensions
3. Load Unpacked -> select the cloned repo folder
4. Go to the extention options page and set your keywords/domains for dimming.
